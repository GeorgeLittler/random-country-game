# Random Country Game

Test your geography skills in this fast-paced country-naming challenge! When a letter and a continent appear on the screen, quickly name a country that starts with the given letter and belongs to the specified continent—before the timer runs out! The faster you answer, the more points you earn. But be strategic—you can’t reuse countries you've already named. The ultimate goal is to name every country in the world.
