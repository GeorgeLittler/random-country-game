# 🌍 Random Country Game

Test your geography skills in this fast-paced country-naming challenge! When a letter and a continent appear on the screen, quickly name a country that starts with the given letter **and** belongs to the specified continent — all before the timer runs out! The faster you answer, the more points you earn. But be strategic: you can’t reuse countries you've already named. The ultimate goal is to name every country in the world.
